NOTE: When trying to test out the book versions such as a starter project on Github and you might ran into issues with having an old gradle files. Android Studio gives an option to convert gradle but that usually fails. The best way to fix this is to use an older Java JDK Here is a video on how to fix selecting an older version of java(Java 11) to get the older gradle to work.
